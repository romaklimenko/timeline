# Timeline

When I was a young boy, I never thought about getting old.

One year seemed to me a very long time. What to say about five years!

It was hard for me to imagine how I will finish the school, find my first job, get married, have kids.

Suddenly I realised what it's already happened with me and I'm not a little boy anymore.

And my dream to be on the cover of Men's Health magazine before I get 25, has not come true because I'm already 33.

And my daughter is already 8 and I live with my wife 10 years, one third of my past life.

After all these thoughts I came to idea to visualise events in my life. I drew a long horizontal line - my life. Under this line I drew shorter lines, for each significant period in my life. This is what I got: http://romaklimenko.com/timeline

I find it very motivating to look on this time after time to save the feeling of where I am, where I could be and where I can be.
